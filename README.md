  <strong>A Pixel-Art Farming Simulation — Built From Scratch</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  A farming and life simulation game built entirely from scratch in JavaScript with no game engine. Custom rendering, custom physics, custom everything — just HTML5 Canvas and code. Features a deep genetic breeding system where you cross-breed plants, discover rare strains, and build a thriving farm with NPCs, quests, and a living world.

## Why From Scratch?

No Unity. No Godot. No Phaser. No engine at all.

Every system in Green Valley — rendering, input handling, collision detection, game loop, UI, audio, saving — was built by hand. This means understanding every line of code that makes the game work, and having total control over how it behaves.

The game runs entirely in a web browser using the HTML5 Canvas 2D API. No installations, no plugins, just open and play.

## Game Features

### 🌾 Farming

Full crop lifecycle from seed to harvest:

```
Seed → Seedling → Vegetative → Flowering → Harvestable
```

- **Soil management** — Nutrients deplete as crops grow; restore with fertilizer
- **Watering system** — Crops need water; track moisture levels per plot
- **Seasons** — Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter affect what grows and how fast
- **Weather effects** — Rain waters your crops; heatwaves stress them; snow halts growth
- **Quality system** — Plant health, water efficiency, and care affect harvest quality

### 🧬 Genetic Breeding System

The signature feature. Cross-breed plants to create offspring with inherited traits:

| Trait | What It Controls |
|-------|-----------------|
| Yield | How much you harvest |
| Quality | Grade of the harvest |
| Growth Speed | How fast it grows |
| Water Efficiency | How much water it needs |
| Disease Resistance | Survival against disease |
| Pest Resistance | Survival against pests |
| THC% | Specialized strain potency |
| CBD% | Specialized strain properties |

**How breeding works:**
- Select two parent plants
- Offspring inherits a mix of both parents' traits
- **5% mutation chance** on each trait (±0.2 variance)
- Color genetics — visual phenotype mixing from parents
- Multi-generation tracking — plants know their lineage

**Strain tiers:**
- **Starter strains** — Basic cultivars for new players
- **Rare strains** — Unlocked through skilled breeding and quests
- **Legendary strains** — Exceptional genetics, extremely rare

### 👥 NPCs & Relationships

8-22 NPCs with daily lives:

- **Schedules** — Each NPC has hourly routines (work, shop, walk, sleep) that vary by day
- **Relationships** — 0-300+ point system: Stranger → Friend → Best Friend → Close
- **Gift system** — Every NPC has loved, liked, neutral, disliked, and hated gifts
- **Occupations** — Herbalist, farmer, merchant, each with role-specific activities
- **Dialogue** — Relationship-level dialogue variants, quest conversations, casual chat

### 🏠 Buildings & Construction

| Building | Function |
|----------|---------|
| Greenhouse | Climate control, humidity regulation, automated watering, weather protection |
| Barn | Storage + animal care |
| Coop | Poultry management |
| Shed | Tool and item storage |
| Silo | Bulk crop storage |
| Well | Water source |
| House | Player home, rest, save point |

Buildings have **tiered upgrades**: Basic → Advanced → Specialized (e.g., Hydroponics greenhouse)

### 🔨 Crafting

100+ recipes across multiple stations:
- **Tools** — Hoe, Watering Can, Axe, Pickaxe, Scythe (with durability tiers)
- **Seeds** — Craft specialized seeds from harvested genetics
- **Products** — Transform raw harvests into sellable goods
- **Quality inheritance** — Output quality based on input ingredient quality

### 📋 Quests & Progression

| Type | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Main story** | 5+ chapter narrative arc |
| **Side quests** | NPC-driven tasks and favors |
| **Daily quests** | Repeatable daily objectives |
| **Weekly quests** | Longer-term challenges |

Multi-stage objectives (e.g., plant seeds → water → harvest → deliver) with XP, gold, item, and blueprint rewards.

### 🏆 Skills & Progression

| Skill | Levels | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Farming** | 1-10+ | Crop growth speed, yield, plot management |
| **Breeding** | 1-10+ | Mutation rates, strain discovery, genetics mastery |
| **Processing** | 1-10+ | Harvest yield, drying/trimming efficiency |
| **Social** | 1-10+ | NPC relationship bonuses, gift effectiveness |

### 💰 Economy

- **Multiple shops** with dynamic pricing and buy/sell restrictions
- **Gold currency** with wallet management
- **Market fluctuations** based on season and supply
- **Stock tracking** — shops restock periodically

### 🌤️ Time & Weather

- **Day/night cycle** — Syncs to your real system clock; street lanterns glow warm from dusk to dawn
- **4 seasons** — 30-day cycles each, affecting crops and NPC behavior
- **Dynamic weather** — Season-specific patterns:
  - Winter: Snow (30%), Clear (70%)
  - Spring: Rain (50%), Storm (20%), Clear (30%)
  - Summer: Heatwave (20%), Rain (20%), Clear (60%)
  - Fall: Wind (30%), Rain (30%), Clear (40%)

### ⚡ Energy System

- **100-point stamina pool** — Actions drain energy (tools, sprinting, farming)
- **Regeneration** — Sleep, food consumption
- **Fatigue** — Reduced efficiency when tired

## How This Was Built

This project was built using **[VybeCoder](https://vybecoder.cloud)** — an execution-verified AI software system that plans, generates, debugs, and verifies complete applications.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that generate snippets and leave you to debug, VybeCoder manages the entire lifecycle: architecture decisions, multi-file coordination, error detection, automated repair, and runtime verification.

**What does that mean in practice?**
- Every file was planned, generated, and tested through VybeCoder's build pipeline
- Errors were caught and fixed automatically — not manually
- The final output was verified to run, not just compile
